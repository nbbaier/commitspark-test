# Commitspark content example: Multi-language component-based Website

Follow these three steps to start using [Commitspark](https://commitspark.com) with this example content repository:

1. [Copy this template](https://github.com/commitspark/example-content-website/generate)
2. [Sign in to Commitspark using your GitHub account](https://commitspark.com/en-us/sign-in/)
3. Select your repository copy and start editing

All content you create will be written to plain text YAML files in your repository on GitHub.

In this example, we have a content model ready to manage content for a multi-language website built from different
content components.

It is meant as a starting-point for building your own content model by
[extending the schema file](schema/schema.graphql) using standard GraphQL types.
